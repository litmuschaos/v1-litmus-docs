##  What is the Litmus Portal

It is a centralized web portal for creating, scheduling, and monitoring [Chaos Workflows](https://v1-docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/chaos-workflows/).
The Litmus Portal simplifies the chaos engineering experience for users by providing multiple features, some of which are listed below. It is 
in the `beta-0` phase as of the 1.11.0 release & is undergoing active [development](https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmus/tree/master/litmus-portal). 

- Ability to launch and manage chaos across Kubernetes clusters (connected as "targets" to the portal)
- Basic authentication with support for organization teaming to collaborate on experiments 
- Wizard to construct workflows by selecting, tuning and ordering experiments from the public [ChaosHub](https://hub.litmuschaos.io) or an alternate 
  ChaosExperiment source (structured similarly, i.e., essentially a [fork](https://github.com/litmuschaos/chaos-charts) of the public source with custom experiments)
- Assignment of weights for chaos experiments in a workflow and derivation of Resilience Score for each workflow run
- Support for repeated execution via workflow schedule  
- Chaos workflow visualization with on-demand log-lookup for individual chaos pods/resources 
- Dashboards to view chaos workflow status & history
- Analytics to compare resilience scores across workflow runs based on custom timelines 

The portal also allows execution of "predefined chaos workflows" that can be uploaded on-demand to aid more customization, especially in the cases where the workflows
involve other Kubernetes actions (such as load generation) apart from chaos experiments. 

Refer to the Litmus Portal [User Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fiN25BrZpvqg0UkBCuqQBE7Mx8BwDGC8ss2j2oXkZNA/edit#) to get started with the installation and usage.
