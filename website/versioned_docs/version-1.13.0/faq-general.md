###  Why should I use Litmus? What is its distinctive feature? 

Litmus is a toolset to do cloud-native Chaos Engineering. Litmus provides tools to orchestrate chaos 
on Kubernetes to help developers and SREs find weaknesses in their application deployments. Litmus can 
be used to run chaos experiments initially in the staging environment and eventually in production to 
find bugs, vulnerabilities. Fixing the weaknesses leads to increased resilience of the system. 
Litmus adopts a “Kubernetes-native” approach to define chaos intent in a declarative manner via custom 
resources.

### What type of chaos experiments are supported by Litmus?

Litmus broadly defines Kubernetes chaos experiments into two categories: application or pod-level chaos 
experiments and platform or infra-level chaos experiments. The former includes pod-delete, container-kill, 
pod-cpu-hog,  pod-network-loss etc., while the latter includes node-drain, disk-loss, node-cpu-hog etc., 
The infra chaos experiments typically have a higher blast radius and impacts more than one application 
deployed on the Kubernetes cluster. Litmus also categorizes experiments on the basis of the applications, 
with the experiments consisting of app-specific health checks. For example, OpenEBS, Kafka, CoreDNS. 

For a full list of supported chaos experiments, visit: https://hub.litmuschaos.io

### What licensing model does Litmus use?

Litmus is developed under Apache License 2.0 license at the project level. Some components of the projects 
are derived from the other Open Source projects and are distributed under their respective licenses.

### What are the prerequisites to get started with Litmus?
 
For getting started with Litmus the only prerequisites is to have Kubernetes 1.11+ cluster. While most 
pod/container level experiments are supported on any Kubernetes platform, some of the infrastructure chaos 
experiments are supported on specific platforms. To find the list of supported platforms for an experiment, 
view the "Platforms" section on the sidebar in the experiment page. 

### How to Install Litmus on the Kubernetes Cluster?

You can install/deploy stable litmus using this command: 

```console
kubectl apply -f https://openebs.github.io/charts/openebs-operator.yaml
```

### What are the permissions required to run Litmus Chaos Experiments?

By default, the Litmus operator uses the “litmus” serviceaccount that is bound to a ClusterRole, in order 
to watch for the ChaosEngine resource across namespaces. However, the experiments themselves are associated 
with “chaosServiceAccounts” which are created by the developers with bare-minimum permissions necessary to 
execute the experiment in question. Visit the [chaos-charts](https://github.com/litmuschaos/chaos-charts) repo 
to view the experiment-specific rbac permissions. For example, here are the [permissions](https://github.com/litmuschaos/chaos-charts/blob/master/charts/generic/container-kill/rbac.yaml) for container-kill chaos.


### What is the scope of a Litmus Chaos Experiment? 

The chaos CRs (chaosexperiment, chaosengine, chaosresults) themselves are namespace scoped and are installed 
in the same namespace as that of the target application. While most of the experiments can be executed with 
service accounts mapped to namespaced roles, some infra chaos experiments typically perform health checks of 
applications across namespaces & therefore need their serviceaccounts mapped to ClusterRoles. 

### How to get started with running chaos experiments using Litmus? 

Litmus has a low entry barrier and is easy to install/use. Typically, it involves installing the chaos-operator, 
chaos experiment CRs from the [charthub](https://hub.litmuschaos.io), annotating an application for chaos and creating 
a chaosengine CR to map your application instance with a desired chaos experiment. Refer to 
the [getting started](https://docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/getstarted/) documentation to learn more on how to run a 
simple chaos experiment. 

### How to view and interpret the results of a chaos experiment? 

The results of a chaos experiment can be obtained from the verdict property of the chaosresult custom resource. 
If the verdict is `Pass`, it means that the application under test is resilient to the chaos injected. 
Alternatively, `Fail` reflects that the application is not resilient enough to the injected chaos, and indicates 
the need for a relook into the deployment sanity or possible application bugs/issues. 

```console
kubectl describe chaosresult <chaosengine-name>-<chaos-experiment> -n <namespace>
```

The status of the experiment can also be gauged by the “status” property of the ChaosEngine. 

```console
Kubectl describe chaosengine <chaosengne-name> -n <namespace>
```

### Do chaos experiments run as a standard set of pods? 

The chaos experiment (triggered after creation of the ChaosEngine resource) workflow consists of launching the “chaos-runner” 
pod, which is an umbrella executor of different chaos experiments listed in the engine. The chaos-runner creates one pod (job) 
per each experiment to run the actual experiment business logic, and also manages the lifecycle of these experiment pods 
(performs functions such as experiment dependencies validation, job cleanup, patching of status back into ChaosEngine etc.,). 
Optionally, a monitor pod is created to export the chaos metrics. Together, these 3 pods are a standard set created upon execution 
of the experiment. The experiment job, in turn may spawn dependent (helper) resources if 
necessary to run the experiments, but this depends on the experiment selected, chaos libraries chosen etc., 

### Is it mandatory to annotate application deployments for chaos? 

Typically applications are expected to be annotated  with `litmuschaos.io/chaos="true"` to lend themselves to chaos. 
This is in order to support selection of the right applications with similar labels in a namespaces, thereby isolating 
the application under test (AUT) & reduce the blast radius. It is also helpful for supporting automated execution 
(say, via cron) as a background service. However, in cases where the app deployment specifications are sacrosanct and 
not expected to be modified, or in cases where annotating a single application for chaos when the experiment itself is 
known to have a higher blast radius doesn’t make sense (ex: infra chaos), the annotationCheck can be disabled via the
ChaosEngine tunable `annotationCheck` (`.spec.annotationCheck: false`).

### How to add Custom Annotations as chaos filters?

Currently Litmus allows you to set your own/custom keys for Annotation filters, the value being `true`/`false`. To use your custom annotation, add this key under an ENV named as `CUSTOM_ANNOTATION` in ChaosOperator deployment. A sample chaos-operator deployment spec is provided here for reference: 

```yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: chaos-operator-ce
  namespace: litmus
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: chaos-operator
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: chaos-operator
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: litmus
      containers:
        - name: chaos-operator
          # 'latest' tag corresponds to the latest released image
          image: litmuschaos/chaos-operator:latest
          command:
          - chaos-operator
          imagePullPolicy: Always
          env:
            - name: CUSTOM_ANNOTATION
              value: "mayadata.io/chaos"
            - name: CHAOS_RUNNER_IMAGE
              value: "litmuschaos/chaos-runner:latest"
            - name: WATCH_NAMESPACE
              value: 
            - name: POD_NAME
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  fieldPath: metadata.name
            - name: OPERATOR_NAME
              value: "chaos-operator"
```

### Is it mandatory for the chaosengine and chaos experiment resources to exist in the same namespace?

Yes. As of today, the chaos resources are expected to co-exist in the same namespace, which, typically is also the 
application's (AUT) namespace.

### How to get the chaos logs in Litmus? 

The chaos logs can be viewed in the following manner. 

To view the successful launch/removal of chaos resources upon engine creation, for identification of 
application under test (AUT) etc., view the chaos-operator logs:
 
```console
kubectl logs -f <chaos-operator-(hash)-(hash)>-runner -n litmus
```

To view lifecycle management logs of a given (or set of) chaos experiments, view the chaos-runner logs:  

```console
kubectl logs -f <chaosengine_name>-runner -n <application_namespace>
```

To view the chaos logs itself (details of experiment chaos injection, application health checks et al), 
view the experiment pod logs: 

```console
kubectl logs -f <experiment_name_(hash)_(hash)> -n <application_namespace>
```

### Does Litmus support generation of events during chaos? 

The chaos-operator generates Kubernetes events to signify the creation of removal of chaos resources over the 
course of a chaos experiment, which can be obtained by running the following command: 

```console
kubectl describe chaosengine <chaosengine-name> -n <namespace> 
```

Note: Efforts are underway to add more events around chaos injection in subsequent releases. 

### How to stop or abort a chaos experiment?

A chaos experiment can be stopped/aborted inflight by patching the `.spec.engineState` property of the chaosengine 
to `stop` . This will delete all the chaos resources associated with the engine/experiment at once. 

```console
kubectl patch chaosengine <chaosengine-name> -n <namespace> --type merge --patch '{"spec":{"engineState":"stop"}}'
```

The same effect will be caused by deleting the respective chaosengine resource. 

### Can a chaos experiment be resumed once stopped or aborted? 

Once stopped/aborted, patching the chaosengine `.spec.engineState` with `active` causes the experiment to be re-executed. Another way is to re-apply the ChaosEngine YAML, this will delete all stale chaos resources, and restart ChaosEngine lifecycle.
However, support is yet to be added for saving state and resuming an in-flight experiment (i.e., execute 
pending iterations etc.,)


```console
kubectl patch chaosengine <chaosengine-name> -n <namespace> --type merge --patch '{"spec":{"engineState":"active"}}'
```

### How to restart chaosengine after graceful completion?

To restart chaosengine, check the `.spec.engineState`, which should be equal to `stop`, which means your chaosengine has gracefully completed, or forcefully aborted. In this case, restart is quite easy, as you can re-apply the chaosengine YAML to restart it. This will remove all stale chaos resources linked to this chaosengine, and restart its own lifecycle.

### Does Litmus support any chaos metrics for experiments?

Litmus provides a basic set of prometheus metrics indicating the total count of chaos experiments, passed/failed 
experiments and individual status of experiments specified in the ChaosEngine, which can be queried against the monitor 
pod. Work to enhance and improve this is underway.

### Does Litmus track any usage metrics on the test clusters?

By default, the installation count of chaos-operator & run count of a given chaos experiment is collected as part 
of general analytics to gauge user adoption & chaos trends. However, if you wish to inhibit this, please use the following 
ENV setting on the chaos-operator deployment: 

```console
env: 
  name: ANALYTICS
  value: 'FALSE' 
```

### What is ChaosScheduler?

ChaosScheduler is an operator built on top of the operator-sdk framework. It keeps on watching resources of kind ChaosSchedule and based on the scheduling parameters automates the formation of ChaosEngines, to be observed by ChaosOperator, instead of manually forming the ChaosEngine every time we wish to inject chaos in the cluster.

### How is ChaosScheduler different from ChaosOperator?

ChaosOperator operates on chaosengines while ChaosScheduler operates on chaosschedules which in turn forms chaosengines, through some scheduling techniques, to be observed by ChaosOperator. So ChaosOperator is a basic building block used to inject chaos in a cluster while ChaosScheduler is just a scheduling strategy that injects chaos in some form of pattern using ChaosOperator only. ChaosScheduler can not be used independently of ChaosOperator.

### What are the pre-requisites for ChaosScheduler?

For getting started with ChaosScheduler, we should just have ChaosOperator and all the litmus infrastructure components installed in the cluster beforehand. 

### How to install ChaosScheduler?

Firstly install the rbac and crd -

```console
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/chaos-scheduler/master/deploy/rbac.yaml

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/chaos-scheduler/master/deploy/crds/chaosschedule_crd.yaml 
```

Install ChaosScheduler operator afterwards -

```console
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/chaos-scheduler/master/deploy/chaos-scheduler.yaml
```

### How to schedule the chaos using ChaosScheduler?

This depends on which type of schedule we want to use for injecting chaos. For basic understanding refer [constructing schedule](https://docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/scheduling/)

### What are the different techniques of scheduling the chaos?

As of now, there are 3 scheduling techniques which can be selected based on the parameter passed to spec.schedule.type

- type=now

- type=once

- type=repeat

### What fields of spec.schedule are to be specified with spec.schedule.type=now?

No fields are needed to be specified for this as it launches the desired chaosengine immediately.

### What fields of spec.schedule  are to be specified with spec.schedule.type=once?

We just need to pass spec.executionTime. Scheduler will launch the chaosengine exactly at the point of time mentioned in this parameter.

### What fields of spec.schedule  are to be specified with spec.schedule.type=repeat?

All the fields of spec.schedule except spec.schedule.executionTime are needed to be specified. 

- startTime
- endTime
- minChaosInterval
- instanceCount
- includedDays

It schedules chaosengines to be launched according to the parameters passed. It works just as a cronjob does, having superior functionalities such as we can control when the schedule will start and end.

### What to choose between minChaosInterval and instanceCount?

Only one should be chosen ideally between minChaosInterval and instanceCount. However if both are specified minChaosInterval will be given priority. 
minChaosInterval specifies the minimum interval that should be present between the launch of 2 chaosengines and instanceCount specifies the exact number of chaosengines to be launched between the range (start and end time). SO we can choose depending on our requirements.
