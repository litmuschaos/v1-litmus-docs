## Prerequisites

- Ensure that the Litmus Chaos Operator is running by executing `kubectl get pods` in operator namespace (typically, `litmus`). If not, install from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/pages/master/docs/litmus-operator-latest.yaml)
- Ensure that the `container-kill` experiment resource is available in the cluster by executing `kubectl get chaosexperiments` in the desired namespace. If not, install from [here](https://hub.litmuschaos.io/charts/generic/experiments/container-kill)
- Cluster should have docker runtime, if the chaos_lib is `pumba`. It should have containerd runtime in cluster, if the chaos_lib is `containerd`.

## Entry Criteria

- Application pods are healthy before chaos injection

## Exit Criteria

- Application pods are healthy post chaos injection

## Details

- Pumba chaoslib details
    - Kills one container in the specified application pod by sending SIGKILL termination signal to its docker socket (hence docker runtime is required)
    - Containers are killed using the `kill` command provided by [pumba](https://github.com/alexei-led/pumba)
    - Pumba is run as a daemonset on all nodes in dry-run mode to begin with the `kill` command is issued during experiment execution via `kubectl exec`
- Containerd chaoslib details
    - Kills one container in the specified application pod by `crictl-chaos` Lib.
    - Containers are killed using the `crictl stop` command.
    - containerd-chaos is run as a daemonset on all nodes in dry-run mode to begin with the `stop` command is issued during experiment execution via `kubectl exec` 
- Tests deployment sanity (replica availability & uninterrupted service) and recovery workflow of the application
- Good for testing recovery of pods having side-car containers

## Integrations

- Container kill is achieved using the `pumba` or `containerd_chaos` chaos library
- The desired pumba and containerd image can be configured in the env variable `LIB_IMAGE`. 

## Steps to Execute the Chaos Experiment

- This Chaos Experiment can be triggered by creating a ChaosEngine resource on the cluster. To understand the values to provide in a ChaosEngine specification, refer [Getting Started](getstarted.md/#prepare-chaosengine)

- Follow the steps in the sections below to create the chaosServiceAccount, prepare the ChaosEngine & execute the experiment.

### Prepare chaosServiceAccount

- Use this sample RBAC manifest to create a chaosServiceAccount in the desired (app) namespace. This example consists of the minimum necessary role permissions to execute the experiment.

#### Sample Rbac Manifest

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount

apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1

- apiGroups: ["","litmuschaos.io","batch","apps"]
  resources: ["pods","jobs","daemonsets","pods/exec","chaosengines","chaosexperiments","chaosresults"]
  verbs: ["create","list","get","patch","update","delete"]

apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: RoleBinding

  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: container-kill-sa
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: container-kill-sa
  namespace: default

```

### Prepare ChaosEngine

- Provide the application info in `spec.appinfo`
- Override the experiment tunables if desired

#### Supported Experiment Tunables

#### Sample ChaosEngine Manifest

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/chaos-charts/master/charts/generic/container-kill/engine.yaml yaml)
```yaml
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: nginx-chaos
  namespace: default
spec:
  # It can be true/false
  annotationCheck: 'true'
  # It can be active/stop
  engineState: 'active'
  #ex. values: ns1:name=percona,ns2:run=nginx 
  auxiliaryAppInfo: ''
  appinfo:
    appns: 'default'
    applabel: 'app=nginx'
    appkind: 'deployment'
  chaosServiceAccount: container-kill-sa
  monitoring: false
  # It can be delete/retain
  jobCleanUpPolicy: 'delete' 
  experiments:
    - name: container-kill
      spec:
        components:
          env:
            # specify the name of the container to be killed
            - name: TARGET_CONTAINER
              value: 'nginx'
```

### Create the ChaosEngine Resource

- Create the ChaosEngine manifest prepared in the previous step to trigger the Chaos.

  `kubectl apply -f chaosengine.yml`

### Watch Chaos progress

- View pod restart count by setting up a watch on the pods in the application namespace

  `watch -n 1 kubectl get pods -n <application-namespace>`

### Check Chaos Experiment Result

- Check whether the application is resilient to the container kill, once the experiment (job) is completed. The ChaosResult resource name is derived like this: `<ChaosEngine-Name>-<ChaosExperiment-Name>`.

  `kubectl describe chaosresult nginx-chaos-container-kill -n <application-namespace>`

## Application Container Kill Demo 

- A sample recording of this experiment execution is provided [here](https://youtu.be/XKyMNdVsKMo).
