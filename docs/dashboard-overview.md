------

While Gitlab does provide a clear representation of build stages via individual pipeline graphs, 
the OpenEBS CI workflow consists of multiple distinct pipelines making it a difficult exercise to 
correlate results & derive desired info. 

[Openebs.ci](https://openebs.ci/) is an online portal that simplifies visualization of this data 
via a CI dashboard, which caters to both the developer and user communities to obtain “build” & 
“e2e” results against commits to the core OpenEBS component repositories across different branches. 

It also provides access to multiple workload dashboards that provide a real-time view of production 
workloads using OpenEBS PVs.
