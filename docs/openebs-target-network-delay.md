## Experiment Metadata

| Type      | Description              | Tested K8s Platform                                               |
| ----------| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OpenEBS   | Induce latency into the cStor target/Jiva controller container | GKE, Konvoy(AWS), Packet(Kubeadm), OpenShift(Baremetal)  |

<b>Note:</b> In this example, we are using nginx as stateful application that stores static pages on a Kubernetes volume. 

## Prerequisites

- Ensure that the Kubernetes Cluster uses Docker runtime
- Ensure that the Litmus Chaos Operator is running
- Ensure that the `openebs-target-network-delay` experiment resource is available in the cluster. If not, install from [here](https://hub.litmuschaos.io/charts/openebs/experiments/openebs-target-network-delay)
- If DATA_PERSISTENCE is 'enabled', provide the application info in a configmap volume so that the experiment can perform necessary checks. Currently, LitmusChaos supports
  data consistency checks only on MySQL databases. Create a configmap as shown below in the application namespace (replace with actual credentials):

  ```
  ---
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ConfigMap
  metadata:
    name: openebs-target-network-delay
  data:
    parameters.yml: | 
      dbuser: root
      dbpassword: k8sDem0
      dbname: test
  ```
- Ensure that the chaosServiceAccount used for the experiment has cluster-scope permissions as the experiment may involve carrying out the chaos in the `openebs` namespace
  while performing application health checks in its respective namespace. 

## Entry Criteria

- Application pods are healthy before chaos injection
- Application writes are successful on OpenEBS PVs

## Exit Criteria

- Stateful application pods are healthy post chaos injection
- OpenEBS Storage target pods are healthy

If the experiment tunable DATA_PERSISTENCE is set to 'enabled':

- Application data written prior to chaos is successfully retrieved/read 
- Database consistency is maintained as per db integrity check utils 

## Details

- This scenario validates the behaviour of stateful applications and OpenEBS data plane upon high latencies/network delays in accessing the storage controller pod
- Injects latency on the specified container in the controller pod by staring a traffic control `tc` process with `netem` rules to add egress delays
- Latency is injected via pumba library with command `pumba netem delay` by passing the relevant network interface, latency, chaos duration and regex filter for container name
- Can test the stateful application's resilience to loss/slow iSCSI connections

## Integrations

- Network delay is achieved using the `pumba` chaos library in case of docker runtime. Support for other other runtimes via tc direct invocation of `tc` will be added soon. 
- The desired lib image can be configured in the env variable `LIB_IMAGE`. 

## Steps to Execute the Chaos Experiment

- This Chaos Experiment can be triggered by creating a ChaosEngine resource on the cluster. To understand the values to provide in a ChaosEngine specification, refer [Getting Started](getstarted.md/#prepare-chaosengine)

- Follow the steps in the sections below to prepare the ChaosEngine & execute the experiment.

### Prepare chaosServiceAccount

Use this sample RBAC manifest to create a chaosServiceAccount in the desired (app)namespace. This example consists of the minimum necessary cluster role permissions to execute the experiment.

#### Sample Rbac Manifest

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: nginx-sa
  namespace: default
  labels:
    name: nginx-sa
---
# Source: openebs/templates/clusterrole.yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: nginx-sa
  labels:
    name: nginx-sa
rules:
- apiGroups: ["","apps","litmuschaos.io","batch","extensions","storage.k8s.io"]
  resources: ["pods","pods/exec","jobs","configmaps","secrets","services","persistentvolumeclaims","storageclasses","persistentvolumes","chaosexperiments","chaosresults","chaosengines"]
  verbs: ["create","list","get","patch","update","delete"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: nginx-sa
  labels:

roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole

  name: nginx-sa
  namespace: default
```

### Prepare ChaosEngine

- Provide the application info in `spec.appinfo`
- Provide the auxiliary applications info (ns & labels) in `spec.auxiliaryAppInfo`
- Override the experiment tunables if desired

```

### Create the ChaosEngine Resource

- Create the ChaosEngine manifest prepared in the previous step to trigger the Chaos.

  `kubectl apply -f chaosengine.yml`

### Watch Chaos progress

- View network delay in action by setting up a ping to the storage controller in the OpenEBS namespace
- Watch the behaviour of the application pod and the OpenEBS data replica/pool pods by setting up in a watch on the respective namespaces

  `watch -n 1 kubectl get pods -n <app/openebs-namespace>`

### Check Chaos Experiment Result

- Check whether the application is resilient to the target network delays, once the experiment (job) is completed. The ChaosResult resource naming 
  convention is: `<ChaosEngine-Name>-<ChaosExperiment-Name>`.

  `kubectl describe chaosresult target-chaos-openebs-target-network-delay -n <application-namespace>`

## OpenEBS Target Network Delay Demo [TODO]

- A sample recording of this experiment execution is provided here.
