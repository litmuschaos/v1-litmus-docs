<strong>Note:</strong> The experiment currently support for GKE cluster with Ubuntu with Docker (Ubuntu) image. The Container-Optimised OS with Containerd needs to have different pre and post chaos check that will be added in subsequent releases.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure that the Litmus Chaos Operator is running by executing `kubectl get pods` in operator namespace (typically, `litmus`). If not, install from [here](https://docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/getstarted/#install-litmus)
- Ensure that the `docker-service-kill` experiment resource is available in the cluster  by executing                         `kubectl get chaosexperiments` in the desired namespace. If not, install from [here](https://hub.litmuschaos.io/api/chaos/master?file=charts/generic/docker-service-kill/experiment.yaml)
- Ensure that the node on which application pod is running should be cordoned before execution of the chaos experiment (before applying the chaosengine manifest) to ensure that the litmus experiment runner pods are not scheduled on it / subjected to eviction. This can be achieved with the following steps: 

  - Get node names against the applications pods: `kubectl get pods -o wide`
  - Cordon the node `kubectl cordon <nodename>`

## Entry Criteria

- Application pods should be healthy before chaos injection.

## Exit Criteria

- Application pods and the node should be healthy post chaos injection.

## Details

- This experiment Causes the application to become unreachable on account of node turning unschedulable (NotReady) due to docker service kill.
- The docker service has been stopped/killed on a node to make it unschedulable for a certain duration i.e `TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION`. The application node should be healthy after the chaos injection and the services should be reaccessable.
- The application implies services. Can be reframed as:
Test application resiliency upon replica getting unreachable caused due to docker service down.
- After experiment ends, you may manually uncordon the specified node so that it can be utilised in future use `kubectl uncordon <node-name>`.

## Integrations

- Docker Service Kill can be effected using the chaos library: `litmus` 
- The desired chaos library can be selected by setting `litmus` as value for the env variable `LIB` 

## Steps to Execute the Chaos Experiment

- This Chaos Experiment can be triggered by creating a ChaosEngine resource on the cluster. To understand the values to provide in a ChaosEngine specification, refer [Getting Started](getstarted.md/#prepare-chaosengine)

- Follow the steps in the sections below to create the chaosServiceAccount, prepare the ChaosEngine & execute the experiment.

### Prepare chaosServiceAccount

- Use this sample RBAC manifest to create a chaosServiceAccount in the desired (app) namespace. This example consists of the minimum necessary role permissions to execute the experiment.

#### Sample Rbac Manifest

```yaml

```

### Prepare ChaosEngine

- Provide the application info in `spec.appinfo`
- Override the experiment tunables if desired in `experiments.spec.components.env`
- To understand the values to provided in a ChaosEngine specification, refer [ChaosEngine Concepts](chaosengine-concepts.md)

    <td> Ensure that the overall length of the chaosresult CR is still < 64 characters </td>

#### Sample ChaosEngine Manifest

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/chaos-charts/master/charts/generic/docker-service-kill/engine.yaml yaml)
```yaml
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: nginx-chaos
  namespace: default
spec:
  # It can be active/stop
  engineState: 'active'
  auxiliaryAppInfo: ''
  chaosServiceAccount: docker-service-kill-sa
  experiments:
    - name: docker-service-kill
      spec:
        components:
        # nodeSelector: 
        #   # provide the node labels
        #   kubernetes.io/hostname: 'node02'
          env:
            - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
              value: '90' # in seconds
              
            - name: TARGET_NODE
              value: ''
```

### Create the ChaosEngine Resource

- Create the ChaosEngine manifest prepared in the previous step to trigger the Chaos.

  `kubectl apply -f chaosengine.yml`

- If the chaos experiment is not executed, refer to the [troubleshooting](https://docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/faq-troubleshooting/) 
  section to identify the root cause and fix the issues.

### Watch Chaos progress

- Setting up a watch over the nodes getting not schedulable in the Kubernetes Cluster
  `watch kubectl nodes`

### Check Chaos Experiment Result

- Check whether the application is resilient after the docker service kill, once the experiment (job) is completed. The ChaosResult resource name is derived like this: `<ChaosEngine-Name>-<ChaosExperiment-Name>`.

  `kubectl describe chaosresult nginx-chaos-docker-service-kill -n <application-namespace>`

## Post Chaos Steps

- In the beginning of experiment, we cordon the node so that chaos-pod won't schedule on the same node (to which we are going kill the docker service) to ensure that the chaos pod will not scheduled on it / subjected to eviction
After experiment ends you can manually uncordon the application node so that it can be utilised in future.

  `kubectl uncordon <node-name>`

## Docker Service Kill Demo [TODO]

- A sample recording of this experiment execution is provided here.
