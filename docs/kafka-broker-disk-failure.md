## Experiment Metadata

| Type  | Description                    | Kafka Distribution   | Tested K8s Platform
| ----- | -------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------
| Kafka | Fail kafka broker disk/storage | Confluent, Kudo-Kafka| GKE

## Prerequisites

- Ensure that the Litmus Chaos Operator is running
- Ensure that Kafka & Zookeeper are deployed as Statefulsets
- If Confluent/Kudo Operators have been used to deploy Kafka, note the instance name, which will be 
  used as the value of `KAFKA_INSTANCE_NAME` experiment environment variable 

  - In case of Confluent, specified by the `--name` flag
  - In case of Kudo, specified by the `--instance` flag
 
  Zookeeper uses this to construct a path in which kafka cluster data is stored. 

- Ensure that the kafka-broker-disk failure experiment resource is available in the cluster. If not, install from [here](https://hub.litmuschaos.io/charts/kafka/experiments/kafka-broker-disk-failure)

- Create a secret with the gcloud serviceaccount key (placed in a file `cloud_config.yml`) named `disk-loss` in the namespace
  where the experiment CRs are created. This is necessary to perform the disk-detach steps from the litmus experiment container.

  `kubectl create secret generic disk-loss --from-file=cloud_config.yml -n <kafka-namespace>` 


## Entry Criteria

- Kafka Cluster (comprising the Kafka-broker & Zookeeper Statefulsets) is healthy

## Exit Criteria

- Kafka Cluster (comprising the Kafka-broker & Zookeeper Statefulsets) is healthy
- Kafka Message stream (if enabled) is unbroken

## Details

- Causes forced detach of specified disk serving as storage for the Kafka broker pod
- Tests deployment sanity (replica availability & uninterrupted service) and recovery workflows of the Kafka cluster
- Tests unbroken message stream when `KAFKA_LIVENESS_STREAM` experiment environment variable is set to `enabled`

## Integrations

- Currently, the disk detach is supported only on GKE using LitmusLib, which internally uses the gcloud tools. 

## Steps to Execute the Chaos Experiment

- This Chaos Experiment can be triggered by creating a ChaosEngine resource on the cluster.
  To understand the values to provide in a ChaosEngine specification, refer [Getting Started](getstarted.md/#prepare-chaosengine) 

- Follow the steps in the sections below to prepare the ChaosEngine & execute the experiment.

### Prepare ChaosEngine

- Provide the application info in `spec.appinfo`
- Provide the experiment tunables. While many tunables have default values specified in the ChaosExperiment CR, some need to be 
  explicitly supplied.

### Create the ChaosEngine Resource 

- Create the ChaosEngine manifest prepared in the previous step to trigger the Chaos. 

  `kubectl apply -f chaosengine.yml`

### Watch Chaos progress  

- View broker pod termination upon disk loss by setting up a watch on the pods in the Kafka namespace

  `watch -n 1 kubectl get pods -n <kafka-namespace>` 

### Check Chaos Experiment Result 

- Check whether the kafka deployment is resilient to the broker disk failure, once the experiment (job) is completed.
  The ChaosResult resource name is derived like this: `<ChaosEngine-Name>-<ChaosExperiment-Name>`.

  `kubectl describe chaosresult kafka-chaos-kafka-broker-disk-failure -n <kafka-namespace>` 

### Kafka Broker Recovery Post Experiment Execution

- The experiment re-attaches the detached disk to the same node as part of recovery steps. However, if the disk is not provisioned
  as a Persistent Volume & instead provides the backing store to a PV carved out of it, the brokers may continue to stay in `CrashLoopBackOff` 
  state (example: as hostPath directory for a Kubernetes Local PV) 

- The complete recovery steps involve: 

  - Remounting the disk into the desired mount point
  - Deleting the affected broker pod to force reschedule
