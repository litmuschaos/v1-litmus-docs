    <td> OpenEBS </td>

<b>Note:</b> In this example, we are using nginx as stateful application that stores static pages on a Kubernetes volume.  

## Prerequisites

- Ensure that the Litmus Chaos Operator is running by executing `kubectl get pods` in operator namespace (typically, `litmus`). If not, install from [here](https://docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/getstarted/#install-litmus)
- Ensure that the `openebs-pool-pod-failure` experiment resource is available in the cluster. If not, install from [here](https://hub.litmuschaos.io/api/chaos/master?file=charts/openebs/openebs-pool-pod-failure/experiment.yaml)
- The DATA_PERSISTENCE can be enabled by provide the application's info in a configmap volume so that the experiment can perform necessary checks. Currently, LitmusChaos supports data consistency checks only for MySQL and Busybox. 
  - For MYSQL data persistence check create a configmap as shown below in the application namespace (replace with actual credentials):

    ```
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: openebs-pool-pod-failure
    data:
      parameters.yml: | 
        dbuser: root
        dbpassword: k8sDem0
        dbname: test
    ```
    - For Busybox data persistence check create a configmap as shown below in the application namespace (replace with actual credentials):

    ```
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: openebs-pool-pod-failure
    data:
      parameters.yml: | 
        blocksize: 4k
        blockcount: 1024
        testfile: exampleFile
    ```
- Ensure that the chaosServiceAccount used for the experiment has cluster-scope permissions as the experiment may involve carrying out the chaos in the `openebs` namespace while performing application health checks in its respective namespace. 

## Entry Criteria

- Application pods are healthy before chaos injection
- Application writes are successful on OpenEBS PVs

## Exit Criteria

- Application pods are healthy post chaos injection
- OpenEBS Storage target pods are healthy

If the experiment tunable DATA_PERSISTENCE is set to 'enabled':

- Application data written prior to chaos is successfully retrieved/read 
- Database consistency is maintained as per db integrity check utils 

## Details

- This scenario validates the behaviour of stateful applications and OpenEBS data plane upon forced termination of the target pod
- Target pool pod are killed using the litmus chaoslib [random pod delete](https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmus-ansible/blob/master/chaoslib/litmus/pod_delete/kill_random_pod.yml)
- Can test the stateful application's resilience to momentary iSCSI connection loss

## Integrations

- Pod delete is achieved using the `litmus` chaos library

## Steps to Execute the Chaos Experiment

- This Chaos Experiment can be triggered by creating a ChaosEngine resource on the cluster. To understand the values to be provided in a ChaosEngine specification, refer [Getting Started](getstarted.md/#prepare-chaosengine)

- Follow the steps in the sections below to prepare the ChaosEngine & execute the experiment.

### Prepare chaosServiceAccount

Use this sample RBAC manifest to create a chaosServiceAccount in the desired (app)namespace. This example consists of the minimum necessary cluster role permissions to execute the experiment.

#### Sample Rbac Manifest

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/chaos-charts/master/charts/openebs/openebs-pool-pod-failure/rbac.yaml yaml)
```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount

  name: pool-pod-failure-sa
  namespace: default
  labels:
    name: pool-pod-failure-sa
---
# Source: openebs/templates/clusterrole.yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1

apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding

  kind: ClusterRole
  name: pool-pod-failure-sa
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: pool-pod-failure-sa
  namespace: default
```

### Prepare ChaosEngine

- Provide the application info in `spec.appinfo`
- Provide the auxiliary applications info (ns & labels) in `spec.auxiliaryAppInfo`
- Override the experiment tunables if desired in `experiments.spec.components.env`
- Provide the configMaps and secrets in `experiments.spec.components.configMaps/secrets`, For more info refer [Sample ChaosEngine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/chaos-charts/master/charts/openebs/sample_openebs_engine_with_data_persistency_enabled.yaml)
- To understand the values to provided in a ChaosEngine specification, refer [ChaosEngine Concepts](chaosengine-concepts.md)

  namespace: default
spec:
  # It can be true/false
  annotationCheck: 'false'

            - name: DEPLOY_TYPE
              value: 'deployment'     
```

### Create the ChaosEngine Resource

- Create the ChaosEngine manifest prepared in the previous step to trigger the Chaos.

  `kubectl apply -f chaosengine.yml`

- If the chaos experiment is not executed, refer to the [troubleshooting](https://docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/faq-troubleshooting/) 
  section to identify the root cause and fix the issues.

### Watch Chaos progress

- View pod restart count by setting up a watch on the pods in the OpenEBS namespace

  `watch -n 1 kubectl get pods -n <application-namespace>`

### Check Chaos Experiment Result

- Check whether the application is resilient to the pool pod failure, once the experiment (job) is completed. The ChaosResult resource naming convention is: `<ChaosEngine-Name>-<ChaosExperiment-Name>`.

  `kubectl describe chaosresult target-chaos-openebs-pool-pod-failure -n <application-namespace>`

## OpenEBS Pool Pod Failure Demo [TODO]

- A sample recording of this experiment execution is provided here.
