    <td> OpenEBS Pool Disk Loss contains chaos to disrupt state of infra resources. Experiments can inject disk loss against OpenEBS pool. </td>
    <td> GKE, AWS (KOPS) </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Prerequisites

- Ensure that the Litmus Chaos Operator is running by executing `kubectl get pods` in operator namespace (typically, `litmus`). If not, install from [here](https://docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/getstarted/#install-litmus)

- Ensure that the `openebs-pool-disk-loss` experiment resource is available in the cluster by executing `kubectl get chaosexperiments` in the specificed namespace. If not, install from [here](https://hub.litmuschaos.io/api/chaos/master?file=charts/openebs/openebs-pool-disk-loss/experiment.yaml)

- The DATA_PERSISTENCE can be enabled by provide the application's info in a configmap volume so that the experiment can perform necessary checks. Currently, LitmusChaos supports data consistency checks only for `MySQL` and `Busybox`.

- For MYSQL data persistence check create a configmap as shown below in the application namespace (replace with actual credentials):

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: openebs-pool-disk-loss
data:
  parameters.yml: | 
    dbuser: root
    dbpassword: k8sDem0
    dbname: test
```
- For Busybox data persistence check create a configmap as shown below in the application namespace (replace with actual credentials):

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: openebs-pool-disk-loss
data:
  parameters.yml: | 
    blocksize: 4k
    blockcount: 1024
    testfile: exampleFile
```
-  There should be administrative access to the platform on which the cluster is hosted, as the recovery of the affected node could be manual. Example gcloud access to the project

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  cloud_config.yml: |-
  # Add the cloud AWS credentials or GCP service account respectively
```

- Ensure that the chaosServiceAccount used for the experiment has cluster-scope permissions as the experiment may involve carrying out the chaos in the `openebs` namespace while performing application health checks in its respective namespace. 

## Entry Criteria

- Application pods are healthy before chaos injection
- Application writes are successful on OpenEBS PVs
- The pool disk is healthy before chaos injection


## Exit Criteria

- Application pods are healthy post chaos injection
- OpenEBS Storage pool pods are healthy
- The disk is healthy after chaos injection

If the experiment tunable DATA_PERSISTENCE is set to 'mysql' or 'busybox':

- Application data written prior to chaos is successfully retrieved/read 
- Database consistency is maintained as per db integrity check utils 

## Details

- This scenario validates the behaviour of stateful applications and OpenEBS disk pool upon disk loss.
- Injects disk loss on the specified OpenEBS disk pool and node pool
- Can test the stateful application's resilience to disk loss

## Integrations

- Disk loss is achieved using the `litmus` chaos library 

## Steps to Execute the Chaos Experiment

- This Chaos Experiment can be triggered by creating a ChaosEngine resource on the cluster. To understand the values to provide in a ChaosEngine specification, refer [Getting Started](getstarted.md/#prepare-chaosengine)

- Follow the steps in the sections below to create the chaosServiceAccount, prepare the ChaosEngine & execute the experiment.

### Prepare chaosServiceAccount

Use this sample RBAC manifest to create a chaosServiceAccount in the desired (app)namespace. This example consists of the minimum necessary cluster role permissions to execute the experiment.

#### Sample Rbac Manifest

### Prepare ChaosEngine

- Provide the application info in `spec.appinfo`
- Provide the auxiliary applications info (ns & labels) in `spec.auxiliaryAppInfo`
- Override the experiment tunables if desired in `experiments.spec.components.env`
- Provide the configMaps and secrets in `experiments.spec.components.configMaps/secrets`, For more info refer [Sample ChaosEngine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/chaos-charts/master/charts/openebs/sample_openebs_engine_with_data_persistency_enabled.yaml)

### Create the ChaosEngine Resource

- Create the ChaosEngine manifest prepared in the previous step to trigger the Chaos.

  `kubectl apply -f chaosengine.yml`

- If the chaos experiment is not executed, refer to the [troubleshooting](https://docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/faq-troubleshooting/) 
  section to identify the root cause and fix the issues.

### Watch Chaos progress

- Watch the behaviour of the application pod and the OpenEBS data replica/pool pods by setting up a watch on the respective namespaces

  `watch -n 1 kubectl get pods -n <application-namespace>`
  `watch -n 1 kubectl get pods -n <openebs-namespace>`

### Check Chaos Experiment Result

- Check whether the application is resilient to the pool disk loss, once the experiment (job) is completed. The ChaosResult resource naming convention is: `<ChaosEngine-Name>-<ChaosExperiment-Name>`.

  `kubectl describe chaosresult pool-chaos-openebs-pool-disk-loss -n <application-namespace>`

## OpenEBS Pool Disk Loss Demo [TODO]

- A sample recording of this experiment execution is provided here.
