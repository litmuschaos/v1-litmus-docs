**Introduction**

Litmus chaos hub is a place where the chaos engineering community members publish their chaos experiments. A set of related chaos experiments are bundled into a `Chaos Chart`. Chaos Charts are classified into the following categories.

- [Generic Chaos](#generic-chaos)
- [Application Chaos](#application-chaos)
- [Platform Chaos](#platform-chaos)



### Generic Chaos 

Chaos actions that apply to generic Kubernetes resources are classified into this category. Following chaos experiments are supported under Generic Chaos Chart

### Application Chaos

While Chaos Experiments under the Generic category offer the ability to induce chaos into Kubernetes resources, it is difficult to analyze and conclude if the chaos induced found a weakness in a given application. The application specific chaos experiments are built with some checks on *pre-conditions* and some expected outcomes after the chaos injection. The result of the chaos experiment is determined by matching the outcome with the expected outcome. 

<div class="danger">
<strong>NOTE:</strong> If the result of the chaos experiment is `pass`, it means that the application is resilient to that chaos.
</div>


#### Benefits of contributing an application chaos experiment

Application developers write negative tests in their CI pipelines to test the resiliency of the applications. These negative can be converted into Litmus Chaos Experiments and contributed to ChaosHub, so that the users of the application can use them in staging/pre-production/production environments to check the resilience. Application environments vary considerably from where they are tested (CI pipelines) to where they are deployed (Production). Hence, running the same chaos tests in the user's environment will help determine the weaknesses of the deployment and fixing such weaknesses leads to increased resilience. 



Following Application Chaos experiments are available on ChaosHub



| Application | Description                               | Chaos Experiments                                         |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| OpenEBS     | Container Attached Storage for Kubernetes | [openebs-pool-pod-failure](openebs-pool-pod-failure.md)<br>[openebs-pool-container-failure](openebs-pool-container-failure.md)<br>[openebs-target-pod-failure](openebs-target-pod-failure.md)<br>[openebs-target-container-failure](openebs-target-container-failure.md)<br>[openebs-target-network-delay](openebs-target-network-delay.md)<br>[openebs-target-network-loss](openebs-target-network-loss.md) |
| Kafka  | Open-source stream processing software     |  [kafka-broker-pod-failure](kafka-broker-pod-failure.md)<br>[kafka-broker-disk-failure](kafka-broker-disk-failure.md)<br>                                                        |

### Platform Chaos

Chaos experiments that inject chaos into the platform resources of Kubernetes are classified into this category. Management of platform resources vary significantly from each other, Chaos Charts may be maintained separately for each platform (For example, AWS, GCP, Azure, etc)

Following Platform Chaos experiments are available on ChaosHub



| Platform | Description                                 | Chaos Experiments |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| AWS      | Amazon Web Services platform. Includes EKS. | None              |
| GCP      | Google Cloud Platform. Includes GKE.        | None              |
| Azure    | Microsoft Azure platform. Includes AKS.     | None              |
