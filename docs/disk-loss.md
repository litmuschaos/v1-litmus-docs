## Prerequisites
-   Ensure that the Litmus Chaos Operator is running by executing `kubectl get pods` in operator namespace (typically, `litmus`). If not, install from [here](https://docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/getstarted/#install-litmus)
-   Ensure that the `disk-loss` experiment resource is available in the cluster by `kubectl get chaosexperiments` in the desired namespace. If not, install from  <a href="https://hub.litmuschaos.io/api/chaos/1.3.0?file=charts/generic/disk-loss/experiment.yaml" target="_blank">here</a>
-   Ensure to create a Kubernetes secret having the gcloud/aws access configuration(key) in the namespace of `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`.
-   There should be administrative access to the platform on which the cluster is hosted, as the recovery of the affected node could be manual. Example gcloud access to the project

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  cloud_config.yml: |-
  # Add the cloud AWS credentials or GCP service account respectively
```

## Entry-Criteria

-   The disk is healthy before chaos injection

## Exit-Criteria

-   The disk is healthy post chaos injection
-   If `APP_CHECK` is true, the application pod health is checked post chaos injection

## Details

-   In this experiment, the external disk is detached from the node for a period equal to the `TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION`.
-   This chaos experiment is supported on GKE and AWS platforms.
-   If the disk is created as part of dynamic persistent volume, it is expected to re-attach automatically. The experiment re-attaches the disk if it is not already attached.

<b>Note:</b> Especially with mounted disk. The remount of disk is a manual step that the user has to perform. 

## Integrations

-   Disk loss is effected using the litmus chaoslib that internally makes use of the aws/gcloud commands

## Steps to Execute the Chaos Experiment

-   This Chaos Experiment can be triggered by creating a ChaosEngine resource on the cluster. To understand the values to provide in a ChaosEngine specification, refer [Getting Started](getstarted.md/#prepare-chaosengine)

-   Follow the steps in the sections below to create the chaosServiceAccount, prepare the ChaosEngine & execute the experiment.

### Prepare chaosServiceAccount

- Use this sample RBAC manifest to create a chaosServiceAccount in the desired (app) namespace. This example consists of the minimum necessary role permissions to execute the experiment.

#### Sample Rbac Manifest

subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: disk-loss-sa
  namespace: default
```

### Prepare ChaosEngine

-   Provide the application info in `spec.appinfo`
-   Provide the auxiliary applications info (ns & labels) in `spec.auxiliaryAppInfo`
-   Override the experiment tunables if desired in `experiments.spec.components.env`
- To understand the values to provided in a ChaosEngine specification, refer [ChaosEngine Concepts](chaosengine-concepts.md)

```

## Create the ChaosEngine Resource
-   Create the ChaosEngine manifest prepared in the previous step to trigger the Chaos.

`kubectl apply -f chaosengine.yml`

## Watch Chaos progress
-   Setting up a watch of the app which is using the disk in the Kubernetes Cluster

`watch -n 1 kubectl get pods`

## Check Chaos Experiment Result
-   Check whether the application is resilient to the disk loss, once the experiment (job) is completed. The ChaosResult resource name is derived like this: <ChaosEngine-Name>-<ChaosExperiment-Name>.

`kubectl describe chaosresult nginx-chaos-disk-loss -n <CHAOS_NAMESPACE>`

## Disk Loss Experiment Demo [TODO]

- A sample recording of this experiment execution is provided here.
