## Experiment Metadata

<table>
  <tr>
    <th> Type </th>
    <th> Description </th>
    <th> Tested K8s Platform </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Generic </td>
    <td> Fail the application pod </td>
    <td> GKE, Konvoy(AWS), Packet(Kubeadm), Minikube, EKS, AKS, TKGi(VMware) </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Prerequisites

- Ensure that the Litmus Chaos Operator is running by executing `kubectl get pods` in operator namespace (typically, `litmus`).If not, install from [here](https://docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/getstarted/#install-litmus)
- Ensure that the `pod-delete` experiment resource is available in the cluster by executing                         `kubectl get chaosexperiments` in the desired namespace. If not, install from [here](https://hub.litmuschaos.io/api/chaos/master?file=charts/generic/pod-delete/experiment.yaml)

## Entry Criteria

- Application pods are healthy before chaos injection

## Exit Criteria

- Application pods are healthy post chaos injection

## Details

- Causes (forced/graceful) pod failure of specific/random replicas of an application resources
- Tests deployment sanity (replica availability & uninterrupted service) and recovery workflow of the application

## Integrations

- The desired chaos library can be selected by setting one of the above options as value for the env variable `LIB`

## Steps to Execute the Chaos Experiment

- This Chaos Experiment can be triggered by creating a ChaosEngine resource on the cluster. To understand the values to provide in a ChaosEngine specification, refer [Getting Started](getstarted.md/#prepare-chaosengine)

- Follow the steps in the sections below to create the chaosServiceAccount, prepare the ChaosEngine & execute the experiment.

### Prepare chaosServiceAccount

- Use this sample RBAC manifest to create a chaosServiceAccount in the desired (app) namespace. This example consists of the minimum necessary role permissions to execute the experiment.

#### Sample Rbac Manifest 

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/chaos-charts/master/charts/generic/pod-delete/rbac.yaml yaml)
```yaml

apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: pod-delete-sa
  namespace: default
  labels:

  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: pod-delete-sa
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: pod-delete-sa
  namespace: default

```

***Note:*** In case of restricted systems/setup, create a PodSecurityPolicy(psp) with the required permissions. The `chaosServiceAccount` can subscribe to work around the respective limitations. An example of a standard psp that can be used for litmus chaos experiments can be found [here](https://docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/next/litmus-psp/).

### Prepare ChaosEngine

- Provide the application info in `spec.appinfo`
- Override the experiment tunables if desired in `experiments.spec.components.env`
- To understand the values to provided in a ChaosEngine specification, refer [ChaosEngine Concepts](chaosengine-concepts.md)

#### Sample ChaosEngine Manifest

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/chaos-charts/master/charts/generic/pod-delete/engine.yaml yaml)
```yaml
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: nginx-chaos
  namespace: default
spec:
  appinfo:
    appns: 'default'
    applabel: 'app=nginx'
    appkind: 'deployment'
  # It can be true/false
  annotationCheck: 'false'
  # It can be active/stop
  engineState: 'active'
  chaosServiceAccount: pod-delete-sa
  # It can be delete/retain
  jobCleanUpPolicy: 'delete'
  experiments:
    - name: pod-delete
      spec:
        components:
          env:
            # set chaos duration (in sec) as desired
            - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
              value: '30'

            # set chaos interval (in sec) as desired
            - name: CHAOS_INTERVAL
              value: '10'
              
            # pod failures without '--force' & default terminationGracePeriodSeconds
            - name: FORCE
              value: 'false'
```

### Create the ChaosEngine Resource

- Create the ChaosEngine manifest prepared in the previous step to trigger the Chaos.

  `kubectl apply -f chaosengine.yml`

- If the chaos experiment is not executed, refer to the [troubleshooting](https://docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/faq-troubleshooting/) 
  section to identify the root cause and fix the issues.

### Watch Chaos progress

- View pod terminations & recovery by setting up a watch on the pods in the application namespace

  `watch -n 1 kubectl get pods -n <application-namespace>`

### Abort/Restart the Chaos Experiment

- To stop the pod-delete experiment immediately, either delete the ChaosEngine resource or execute the following command: 

  `kubectl patch chaosengine <chaosengine-name> -n <namespace> --type merge --patch '{"spec":{"engineState":"stop"}}'` 

- To restart the experiment, either re-apply the ChaosEngine YAML or execute the following command: 

  `kubectl patch chaosengine <chaosengine-name> -n <namespace> --type merge --patch '{"spec":{"engineState":"active"}}'`

### Check Chaos Experiment Result

- Check whether the application is resilient to the pod failure, once the experiment (job) is completed. The ChaosResult resource name is derived like this: `<ChaosEngine-Name>-<ChaosExperiment-Name>`.

  `kubectl describe chaosresult nginx-chaos-pod-delete -n <application-namespace>`

## Application Pod Failure Demo

- A sample recording of this experiment execution is provided [here](https://youtu.be/X3JvY_58V9A)
