## <font size="6">Containerized & Deployable Test Cases</font>

Test business logic is executed from inside “runner” pods managed by the Kubernetes 
job controller. All the test aids, such as load generation tools, failure/chaos 
injection utilities, logging mechanisms are also deployed as containers. A Litmus 
e2e test is defined, maintained and deployed (run) as a single or set of simple 
Kubernetes Job Specifications.

## <font size="6">Platform Agnostic</font>

As a consequence of being containerized & Kubernetes native, Litmus tests can be run 
across different Kubernetes platforms, with minimal or no changes to the tests - from 
managed services (GKE, AKS, EKS) to cloud hosted (KOPS based GCP, AWS), baremetal 
cloud (kubespray/kubeadm based Packet) and on-premise solutions (Openshift).

## <font size="6">Written in Ansible, Powered by Kubectl</font>

One of the primary considerations while designing the litmus framework was to keep 
the test workflows & code - as  “DevOps-Centric” as possible, thereby allowing for 
greater end user-participation in the definition & implementation of test scenarios. 
Ansible was used as it has been the DSL of choice in the management of infrastructure 
in the devops world, with increasing scripting/programmatic capabilities every release. 
Litmus e2e, in some ways, is more about application & infrastructure manipulation 
than anything else. In the same vein, kubectl, the powerful Kubernetes CLI tool with 
rich support for object management & filters, has been used for all cluster interactions.

## <font size="6">Uses Microservice Philosophy (Do one thing, Do it well)</font>

Litmus provides separate litmusbooks for various functions such as application deployment 
and deprovision, load generation, monitoring, specific day 1/2 ops, chaos/failure 
injections etc., in order to enable their use, individually, in non-testcase contexts 
(i.e., outside of CI pipelines) as well as provide better debuggability when ordered 
together as different stages of an “e2e” test. 

## <font size="6">Leverage Open source Chaos Tools</font>

Litmus uses capabilities of popular tools such as pumba & chaostoolkit in order to 
induce chaos in the kubernetes cluster, while using home-grown techniques 
(think privileged daemonsets inducing service loss & resource exhaustion!) where 
necessary.

## <font size="6">Easily Extensible</font>

Litmus currently works with a wide range of stateful applications, uses different 
workload generators and supports OpenEBS & Local PV storage providers. It has an 
inherently extensible architecture, wherein different type of tools and test code 
(say, for ex. A new BDD test written in GO) can be accomodated to run as a “litmus test”, 
provided they are containerized & can run on the Kubernetes cluster. 

## <font size="6">Integration with CI Pipelines</font>

Litmus lends itself to easy integration with CI/CD pipelines, due to minimal 
pre-requisites and simple result mechanisms. It also provides utilities for quick setup 
of Kubernetes clusters on different platforms as well as installation of storage provider 
control plane components (operators). [Openebs.ci](https://openebs.ci) is a reference 
implementation of the above.
