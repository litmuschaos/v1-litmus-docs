<b>Note:</b> In this example, we are using nginx as stateful application that stores static pages on a Kubernetes volume. 

## Prerequisites

- Ensure that the Kubernetes Cluster uses Docker runtime
- Ensure that the Litmus Chaos Operator is running by executing `kubectl get pods` in operator namespace (typically, `litmus`). If not, install from [here](https://docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/getstarted/#install-litmus)
- Ensure that the `openebs-target-network-loss` experiment resource is available in the cluster. If not, install from [here](https://hub.litmuschaos.io/api/chaos/master?file=charts/openebs/openebs-target-network-loss/experiment.yaml)
- The DATA_PERSISTENCE can be enabled by provide the application's info in a configmap volume so that the experiment can perform necessary checks. Currently, LitmusChaos supports data consistency checks only for MySQL and Busybox. 
    - For MYSQL data persistence check create a configmap as shown below in the application namespace (replace with actual credentials):

    ```
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: openebs-target-network-loss
    data:
      parameters.yml: | 
        dbuser: root
        dbpassword: k8sDem0
        dbname: test
    ```
    - For Busybox data persistence check create a configmap as shown below in the application namespace (replace with actual credentials):

    ```
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: openebs-target-network-loss
    data:
      parameters.yml: | 
        blocksize: 4k
        blockcount: 1024
        testfile: exampleFile
    ```
- Ensure that the chaosServiceAccount used for the experiment has cluster-scope permissions as the experiment may involve carrying out the chaos in the `openebs` namespace
  while performing application health checks in its respective namespace. 

## Entry Criteria

- Application pods are healthy before chaos injection
- Application writes are successful on OpenEBS PVs

## Exit Criteria

- Stateful application pods are healthy post chaos injection
- OpenEBS Storage target pods are healthy

If the experiment tunable DATA_PERSISTENCE is set to 'enabled':

- Application data written prior to chaos is successfully retrieved/read 
- Database consistency is maintained as per db integrity check utils 

## Details

- This scenario validates the behaviour of stateful applications and OpenEBS data plane upon high latencies/network loss in accessing the storage controller pod
- Injects network loss on the specified container in the controller pod by starting a traffic control `tc` process with `netem` rules to add egress delays
- Network loss is injected via pumba library with command `pumba netem delay` by passing the relevant network interface, network loss, chaos duration and regex filter for container name
- Can test the stateful application's resilience to loss/slow iSCSI connections

## Integrations

- Network loss is achieved using the `pumba` chaos library in case of docker runtime. Support for other other runtimes via tc direct invocation of `tc` will be added soon. 
- The desired lib image can be configured in the env variable `LIB_IMAGE`. 

## Steps to Execute the Chaos Experiment

- This Chaos Experiment can be triggered by creating a ChaosEngine resource on the cluster. To understand the values to provide in a ChaosEngine specification, refer [Getting Started](getstarted.md/#prepare-chaosengine)

- Follow the steps in the sections below to prepare the ChaosEngine & execute the experiment.

### Prepare chaosServiceAccount

Use this sample RBAC manifest to create a chaosServiceAccount in the desired (app)namespace. This example consists of the minimum necessary cluster role permissions to execute the experiment.

#### Sample Rbac Manifest

```

### Prepare ChaosEngine

- Provide the application info in `spec.appinfo`
- Provide the auxiliary applications info (ns & labels) in `spec.auxiliaryAppInfo`
- Override the experiment tunables if desired in `experiments.spec.components.env`
- Provide the configMaps and secrets in `experiments.spec.components.configMaps/secrets`, For more info refer [Sample ChaosEngine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/chaos-charts/master/charts/openebs/sample_openebs_engine_with_data_persistency_enabled.yaml)
- To understand the values to provided in a ChaosEngine specification, refer [ChaosEngine Concepts](chaosengine-concepts.md)

```

### Create the ChaosEngine Resource

- Create the ChaosEngine manifest prepared in the previous step to trigger the Chaos.

  `kubectl apply -f chaosengine.yml`

### Watch Chaos progress

- View network loss in action by setting up a ping to the storage controller in the OpenEBS namespace
- Watch the behaviour of the application pod and the OpenEBS data replica/pool pods by setting up in a watch on the respective namespaces

  `watch -n 1 kubectl get pods -n <application-namespace>`

### Check Chaos Experiment Result

- Check whether the application is resilient to the target network loss, once the experiment (job) is completed. The ChaosResult resource naming 
  convention is: `<ChaosEngine-Name>-<ChaosExperiment-Name>`.

  `kubectl describe chaosresult target-chaos-openebs-target-network-loss -n <application-namespace>`

## OpenEBS Target Network Loss Demo [TODO]

- A sample recording of this experiment execution is provided here.
