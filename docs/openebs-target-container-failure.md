<b>Note:</b> In this example, we are using nginx as stateful application that stores static pages on a Kubernetes volume.  

## Prerequisites

- Ensure that the Litmus Chaos Operator is running by executing `kubectl get pods` in operator namespace (typically, `litmus`). If not, install from [here](https://docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/getstarted/#install-litmus)
- Ensure that the `openebs-target-container-failure` experiment resource is available in the cluster. If not, install from [here](https://hub.litmuschaos.io/api/chaos/master?file=charts/openebs/openebs-target-container-failure/experiment.yaml)
- The DATA_PERSISTENCE can be enabled by provide the application's info in a configmap volume so that the experiment can perform necessary checks. Currently, LitmusChaos supports data consistency checks only for MySQL and Busybox. 
    - For MYSQL data persistence check create a configmap as shown below in the application namespace (replace with actual credentials):

    ```
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: openebs-target-container-failure
    data:
      parameters.yml: | 
        dbuser: root
        dbpassword: k8sDem0
        dbname: test
    ```
    - For Busybox data persistence check create a configmap as shown below in the application namespace (replace with actual credentials):

    ```
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: openebs-target-container-failure
    data:
      parameters.yml: | 
        blocksize: 4k
        blockcount: 1024
        testfile: exampleFile
    ```
- Ensure that the chaosServiceAccount used for the experiment has cluster-scope permissions as the experiment may involve carrying out the chaos in the `openebs` namespace
  while performing application health checks in its respective namespace. 

-  Ensure that you have adequate amount of `CPU` and `Memory` resources available in your cluster to run the experiment.

## Entry Criteria

- Application pods are healthy before chaos injection
- Application writes are successful on OpenEBS PVs

## Exit Criteria

- Stateful application pods are healthy post chaos injection
- OpenEBS Storage target pods are healthy

If the experiment tunable DATA_PERSISTENCE is set to 'enabled':

- Application data written prior to chaos is successfully retrieved/read 
- Database consistency is maintained as per db integrity check utils 

## Details

- This scenario validates the behaviour of stateful applications and OpenEBS data plane upon forced termination of the controller container
- Kills the specified container in the controller pod by sending SIGKILL termination signal to its docker socket (hence docker runtime is required)
- Containers are killed using the `kill` command provided by [pumba](https://github.com/alexei-led/pumba)
- Pumba is run as a daemonset on all nodes in dry-run mode to begin with; the `kill` command is issued during experiment execution via `kubectl exec`
- Can test the stateful application's resilience to momentary iSCSI connection loss

## Integrations

- Container kill is achieved using the `pumba` chaos library in case of docker runtime, & `litmuslib` using `crictl` tool in case of containerd runtime. 
- The desired lib image can be configured in the env variable `LIB_IMAGE`. 

## Steps to Execute the Chaos Experiment

- This Chaos Experiment can be triggered by creating a ChaosEngine resource on the cluster. To understand the values to be provided in a ChaosEngine specification, refer [Getting Started](getstarted.md/#prepare-chaosengine)

- Follow the steps in the sections below to create the chaosServiceAccount, prepare the ChaosEngine & execute the experiment.

### Prepare chaosServiceAccount

- Use this sample RBAC manifest to create a chaosServiceAccount in the desired (app) namespace. This example consists of the minimum necessary role permissions to execute the experiment.

#### Sample Rbac Manifest

### Prepare ChaosEngine

- Provide the application info in `spec.appinfo`
- Override the experiment tunables if desired in `experiments.spec.components.env`
- Provide the auxiliary applications info (ns & labels) in `spec.auxiliaryAppInfo`
- Provide the configMaps and secrets in `experiments.spec.components.configMaps/secrets`, For more info refer [Sample ChaosEngine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/chaos-charts/master/charts/openebs/sample_openebs_engine_with_data_persistency_enabled.yaml)
- To understand the values to provided in a ChaosEngine specification, refer [ChaosEngine Concepts](chaosengine-concepts.md)

```

### Create the ChaosEngine Resource

- Create the ChaosEngine manifest prepared in the previous step to trigger the Chaos.

  `kubectl apply -f chaosengine.yml`

- If the chaos experiment is not executed, refer to the [troubleshooting](https://docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/faq-troubleshooting/) 
  section to identify the root cause and fix the issues.

### Watch Chaos progress

- View pod restart count by setting up a watch on the pods in the OpenEBS namespace

  `watch -n 1 kubectl get pods -n <application-namespace>`

### Check Chaos Experiment Result

- Check whether the application is resilient to the target container kill, once the experiment (job) is completed. The ChaosResult resource naming convention 
  is: `<ChaosEngine-Name>-<ChaosExperiment-Name>`.

  `kubectl describe chaosresult target-chaos-openebs-target-container-failure -n <application-namespace>`

## Recovery 

- If the verdict of the ChaosResult is `Fail`, and/or the OpenEBS components do not return to healthy state post the chaos experiment, then please refer the [OpenEBS troubleshooting guide](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/troubleshooting.html#volume-provisioning) for more info on how to recover the same. 

## OpenEBS Target Container Failure Demo [TODO]

- A sample recording of this experiment execution is provided here.
