### Q. Why Should I use Litmus?

<b>Ans:</b> Litmus is a toolset to do cloud-native chaos engineering. Litmus provides tools to orchestrate chaos on Kubernetes to help SREs find weaknesses in their deployments. SREs use Litmus to run chaos experiments initially in the staging environment and eventually in production to find bugs, vulnerabilities. Fixing the weaknesses leads to increased resilience of the system.

### Q. What are the Pre-requisites to get started with Litmus?

<b>Ans:</b> For getting started with Litmus the only Pre-requisites is to have Kubernetes 1.11 or later version installed in your system.

Toggle monitoring between true/false, to allow the chaos-exporter to fetch experiment related metrics. Change the chaosServiceAccount to the name of Service Account created in the above step, if applicable.

### Q. How to install Chaos Experiments manually?

<b>Ans:</b> Chaos experiments contain the actual chaos details. These experiments are installed on your cluster as Kubernetes CRs (Custom Resources). The Chaos Experiments are grouped as Chaos Charts and are published on <a href="https://hub.Litmuschaos.io/">Chaos Hub</a>.

 Where chaos-engine-name is the name of Chaos Engine or if you want to delete all chaosengine present use the following command 
 `kubectl delete chaosengine <chaos-engine-name>-runner --all`

 `kubectl delete chaosexperiment <experiment-name> --all`

#### Q. How will I know that the chaos has injected successfully?

<b>Ans:</b> To check whether the chaos has injected successfully or nor check verdict in the chaosresult of the experiment. Use the following command to get the chaosresult.
`kubectl describe chaosresult <chaos-engine-name>-<chaos-experiment-name>`. Check the `spec.verdict` in the chaos result. The spec.verdict is set to `Running` when the experiment is in progress, eventually changing to either `pass` or `fail`.
